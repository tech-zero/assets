### Day 2 Lab 1 
### Part 3: Configure Routing Protocols
In this part, you configure IPv4 and IPv6 routing protocols.  At the end of this part, the  
network should be fully converged.  IPv4 and IPv6 pings to the ISP router's Loopback 0  
interface from DIST1 and DIST2 should be successful.

---
### Note
Pings fromthe hosts will not be successful because their default gateways are pointing  
to the HSRP address, which is enabled in Part 4.
