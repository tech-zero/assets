### Day 2 Lab 1 
### Part 1: Build the Network and Configure Basic Device Settings and Interface Addressing
In Part 1, you set up the network topology and configure basic settings and interface addressing.  
Follow these steps:  

 **Step 1.** Build the network, as shown in the topology in address table.  
   Attach the devices as shown in the topology diagram and connect them as necessary.

**Step 2.** Configure the basic settings for each device:  
   **a.** Console into each device, enter global configuration mode, and apply the basic settings.  
   **b.** Save the running configuration to startup-config on all devices.  
   **c.** Configure PC1 and PC4 host addressing as shown in the addressing table.  Assign the default gateway address 172.16.100.254, which will be the HSRPv2 virtual IP address used in Part 4.
